#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
#OR
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, ROUND(SUM(quantity) * price,2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity) * price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT ROUND(AVG(quantity*price),2) AS Avg, COUNT(distinct acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
JOIN BIT_DB.customers ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(order_id)=6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'
